Facial recognition is a biometric alternative that measures unique characteristics of a human
face. Applications available today include flight check in, tagging friends and family members in
photos, and “tailored” advertising. You are a computer vision engineer who needs to develop a
face recognition programme with deep convolutional neural networks.
Objective: Use a deep convolutional neural network to perform facial recognition using Keras.
